# Architecture Change Management – runvia.dev

This document outlines how architectural changes for the runvia.dev platform are evaluated, documented, and integrated over time. It ensures the architecture remains aligned with project goals and continues to support scalability, maintainability, and transparency.

---

## 🎯 Purpose

To define a repeatable, lightweight process for managing changes to architecture models, solution designs, and documentation as the project evolves.

---

## 🛠️ Change Triggers

Changes to the architecture are reviewed when one or more of the following occurs:

- New features or tools are added (e.g. blog engine, micro-tools)
- Core technologies are replaced (e.g. new frontend framework, new database)
- Infrastructure changes (e.g. new CI/CD tools, host migration)
- Changes to non-functional requirements (e.g. performance, accessibility)
- Unexpected deviations during implementation or bug resolution

---

## 🔁 Change Process

All architectural changes must follow this cycle:

1. **Assess Impact**
   - What part of the model does this affect?
   - Which diagrams, documents, or components need updating?

2. **Update Architecture**
   - Modify `.drawio` diagrams accordingly
   - Update or append to relevant `.md` documentation files

3. **Review**
   - Perform self-review to ensure updates align with principles and objectives
   - If needed, note architectural deviations or rationale

4. **Version and Commit**
   - Commit all changes to GitHub
   - Use clear commit messages (e.g. `update: updated capability map for new tool section`)
   - Tag version if change is major (e.g. `v1.1-architecture`)

---

## 📝 Exception Handling

For each major deviation, create an entry in `exceptions.md` or as a comment in the relevant architecture file:

Example:

```markdown
Exception – 2025-07-15:
Replaced Traefik with Caddy due to simpler config needs. Updated Solution and App/Data Architecture diagrams accordingly.
