# Architecture Principles for runvia.dev

1. **Simplicity First** – The solution should be as simple as possible and only as complex as needed.
2. **Automation by Design** – CI/CD pipelines, tests, and deployment automation should be integrated early.
3. **Modular Structure** – Frontend and backend should be loosely coupled and replaceable.
4. **Documentation as a Deliverable** – Every decision and technical implementation must be documented.
5. **Performance & SEO Awareness** – The website should load fast and be optimized for search engine visibility.
6. **Open by Default** – Source code and documentation should be public unless there’s a clear reason not to.
