# Migration Plan â€“ runvia.dev

This document describes the phased implementation plan for deploying the architecture of runvia.dev. It outlines the defined work packages (WPs) and groups them into sequential phases that support the delivery of solution building blocks (SBBs) identified in Phase 5.

---

## ðŸŽ¯ Migration Strategy

The migration is divided into three main implementation phases, each focusing on a coherent set of technical deliverables. Work packages are defined to be modular and deployable in incremental steps.

---

## ðŸ“¦ Phase 1: Core UI & Backend

| Work Package | Description |
|--------------|-------------|
| **WP1 â€“ Static Frontend** | Build the React-based frontend with placeholder project data and basic layout |
| **WP2 â€“ API Backend** | Create a working FastAPI backend with REST endpoints, serving static data initially |

âœ… Goal: Achieve a minimal functional portfolio site with static content and a working backend structure.

---

## ðŸ”§ Phase 2: Integration & Routing

| Work Package | Description |
|--------------|-------------|
| **WP3 â€“ Contact Integration** | Implement contact form functionality (e.g., email or local message store) |
| **WP4 â€“ Traefik Setup** | Configure Traefik for HTTP/HTTPS reverse proxy and routing to frontend/backend |

âœ… Goal: Enable interactive communication and prepare the system for full-stack connectivity.

---

## ðŸš€ Phase 3: DevOps & Automation

| Work Package | Description |
|--------------|-------------|
| **WP5 â€“ Docker Setup** | Define and test Docker Compose for local and production deployment |
| **WP6 â€“ GitHub Actions** | Build basic CI/CD pipeline for code validation and deployment automation |

âœ… Goal: Streamline deployment, support automated workflows, and improve delivery confidence.

## âœ… Next Step

Following this migration plan, implementation should begin with WP1 and WP2 in a local development environment. Traefik and Docker Compose setup will then allow integration testing, before introducing automation workflows via GitHub Actions.
