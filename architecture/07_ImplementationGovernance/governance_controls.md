# Implementation Governance – runvia.dev

This document describes how implementation of the runvia.dev architecture will be monitored, validated, and kept aligned with the defined architecture principles, models, and migration roadmap.

The governance model is lightweight but structured, and built for a solo developer context.

---

## 🧭 Objectives

- Ensure each work package delivers what was defined in Phase 5 and 6
- Maintain architectural alignment with capabilities, principles, and models
- Enable rapid feedback and reflection on implementation outcomes
- Support decision transparency when deviations occur

---

## 📐 Governance Controls

### 1. Architecture Conformance

- All solution elements implemented (e.g. React Frontend, FastAPI Backend, etc.) must correspond to elements modeled in the **Solutions Overview** and **App/Data Architecture**
- Reuse naming and structure from diagrams for clarity

### 2. Code Quality and Standards

- Use linters and formatters:
  - Frontend: ESLint, Prettier
  - Backend: Black, isort (Python)
- Write docstrings and comments for backend logic
- Use clear, named commits in GitHub with links to relevant Work Package (e.g. `feat: implement WP1 - Static Frontend`)

### 3. CI/CD Process Governance

- GitHub Actions workflow must:
  - Lint/test code before deploy
  - Deploy only from `main`
  - Be documented and versioned (`.github/workflows/`)
- CI/CD must reflect **WP6** delivery scope

### 4. Documentation Requirements

- Every work package must result in updated:
  - `.drawio` diagrams if structure changed
  - `.md` file summaries if behavior changed
- README.md must reflect deployed status (e.g. “Contact Form is active”)

### 5. Self-Review and Feedback

- At the end of each implementation phase:
  - Revisit the original Work Packages
  - Ask: “Did I implement what I designed?”
  - Document gaps or scope changes under “Exceptions”

### 6. Exceptions Tracking

Any deviation from the migration plan must be documented with:

- What changed
- Why it was necessary
- Whether the architecture was updated to reflect it

Example:

```markdown
❌ Exception – WP2:
Planned “CV Document” download feature was postponed due to lack of content. Feature removed from FastAPI and diagram updated.
